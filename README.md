## Assignment

### Setup
- Accept the assignment by clicking on the Github classroom link that will be emailed to you.

### Server
- The requirements that you stated in your SRS must each be implemented.  If a requirement is too difficult then change or remove it.  If you decide to add additional functionality, then add a requirement.  Remember that the SRS can be changed up until you turn in the project. 
### Rules - The Server will be graded using the Rubric shown in class with these additional guidelines
1. The Server must be an API that uses the RESTful architecture.
2. The Server must use Node just like we have in class.
3. For simplicity, the Server should be run using Express.js like in homework 6 - API.  You are allowed to run the Server using other api servers but I will need very good instructions on how to run the code (not recommended).
4. The Server must provide endpoints for basic httpRequests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
5. The Server must peristently store information either in a file or in a database.
6. Please try to use JavaScript properly like has been shown in class.  i.e. Arrow Functions, Proper handling of Promises, etc.
